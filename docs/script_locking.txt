/** 
* CARE 2xxx Integrated Hospital Information System
* This is the chaining and language detection routine. It should be included at the beginning of each script that
* must be protected from a direct execution triggered from outside. It also loads the appropriate language table.
*
* ::::::: USAGE ::::::::
* At every start of a script that must be protected, write the following lines of code:
*
*    define('LANG_FILE','name_of_language_table.php');
*    define('NO_2LEVEL_CHK',1);
*    require($root_path.'include/inc_front_chain_lang.php');
*
* If the script is protected w/ the second level security chaining, write instead the following code:
*
*    define('LANG_FILE','name_of_language_table.php');
*    $local_user='edp_access_user';
*    require($root_path.'include/inc_front_chain_lang.php');
*
*    Where "edp_access_user" is the name of the cookie set at a successful password check
*
* If the script is not protected w/ security chaining but requires language detection write instead:
*
*    define('LANG_FILE','name_of_language_table.php');
*    define('NO_CHAIN',1);
*    require($root_path.'include/inc_front_chain_lang.php');
*
* If the script does not require a language table, define the LANG_FILE to "" (empty string).
*    define('LANG_FILE','');
*    define('NO_2LEVEL_CHK',1);
*    require($root_path.'include/inc_front_chain_lang.php');
