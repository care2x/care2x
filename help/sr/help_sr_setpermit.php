<b>Setting an access permission</b><p>
Due to high security requirements in health care systems, you cannot create an access permission all by yourself. The access permission
is usually created for you by a designated employee in the IT department of your organization.
<p>
<b>What to do?</b>
<p>
Apply for an access permission through the official channels as outlined in your organization's rules and regulations.
You can try the following contact information:<p>
<blockquote>
Name of designated person:<br>
Department's address:<br>
Telephone nr:<br>
Fax nr:<br>
Intercom nr:<p>
Application form
