To proceed you have to
enter some hospital services like Rooms, Nursing, Oxygen or whatever.
Similarly enter Lab services like Blood test, Urine test etc with their
codes and unit costs and discounts. Then from the menu search for a patient
and select hospital or lab services used by that patient. The data you
entered will be shown in the appropriate tables.

After a patient uses a service it will be reflected in his bill under view
bill section. All the items that are shown in the bill will remain as
unbilled until the user saves or prints the bill. Similarly the user can
accept payments from patients at any time. A bill shows the total amount for
the items, and outstanding amount and amount due (bill+outstanding). The
outstanding amount is calculated as total billed (saved bill) amount till
the last bill minus total payments recieved. So if one has paid advance then
the outstanding is shown as zero an total due comes as negative.

The final bill can be generated only after all services that the patient
used has been billed.
