  /public_html/ etc. (directory enable web access.)
       |
       | -- sample.html (maked HTML file as "How to describe HTML".)

       | -- /dicomviewer/ (extract download ClassFile here.)
       |        |
       |        | -- Viewer.class
       |        | -- etc.
       |
       | -- /data/ (It would be better to put DICOM file here.)
                |
                | -- sample.dcm
                | -- etc.

[SETTING TO JAVA]
JRE 1.4.2_06 or more is necessary,so install it.
  -->http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html

if you want to use JPEG transfer syntax,following setting is necessary.
Install Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools.
  -->http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/index.jsp

And add the following to the file of the name of ".java.policy"
and copy it onto an appropriate place.
ex)
   grant codeBase "http://hogehoge.ho.ge/" {                                   //your URL that is set up applet
      permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "loadLibrary.*";                  //You need not change. 
      permission java.util.PropertyPermission "*", "read";                     //You need not change. 
      permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\\Program Files\\java\\-", "read";  //your local folder that is set up JRE
   };

There is ".java.policy" file in "java\jre\lib\security\".
For example,appropriate place is home directory.
windows example,
uC:\Documents and Settings\(account)\v

If you want to check kind of jpeg image that can be read,please see following URL.
  -->http://mars.elcom.nitech.ac.jp/dicom/check-jpeg.html
And add the following to the file of the name of ".java.policy"
ex)
   grant codeBase "http://mars.elcom.nitech.ac.jp/dicom/" {                    //You need not change.
      permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "loadLibrary.*";                  //You need not change. 
      permission java.util.PropertyPermission "*", "read";                     //You need not change. 
      permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\\Program Files\\java\\-", "read";  //your local folder that is set up JRE
   };

If your setting is right , you can see words of [JPEG2000],[JPEG-LOSSLESS],etc...
If you can't see it , your setting is wrong.So,please check your setting while seeing "ReadMe.txt".
